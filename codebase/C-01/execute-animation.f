\  Behaviour Routine: Execute one of a number of possible animations.
\   Make the code such that each component is demarcated as a 'module' that can be interchanged.

\ Indicate Mood Interaction
\ if (happy)    - spin clockwise +1 rotation [ 1-motor CW; 2-motor CCW ] | How to determine that enough rot for returning to facing the user?
\ if (pensive)  - move (forward) +1 rot, move (backward) -1 rot
\ if (...)
\ else          - spin counterclockwise  -1 rotation [ 1-motor CCW; 2-motor CW ] | Same concern here as the one above.
